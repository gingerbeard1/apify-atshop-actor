# Apify Atshop Actor

This is an Apify actor that allows you to scrape information from shops on Atshop.io.

## Description

This actor utilizes Apify SDK, Axios, and Cheerio to fetch and parse the HTML content of Atshop.io shops. It can extract various data from the shops, including shop names, descriptions, links, and contact information. It also performs regex text detection to parse emails, Telegram usernames/channels/groups, Discord servers, and Cash App usernames and cash tags.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the Apify CLI installed. If not, install it by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install -g apify-cli
   ```

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd apify-atshop-actor
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your Apify API token. If you don't have one, create a new token in the Apify Dashboard.

5. Run the actor locally using the Apify CLI:
   ```
   apify run
   ```

6. Configure the input settings as required. You can provide a list of specific shop names or use keywords for search input to scrape the Atshop.io shops.

7. Monitor the scraping progress in the console output. The extracted data will be saved to a dataset.

## Input

The actor expects the following input:

- `shopNames` (optional): A list of specific shop names to scrape. If not provided, the actor will use keywords for search input.
